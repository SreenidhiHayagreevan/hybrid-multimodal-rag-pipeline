- source_sentence: Why was the cash used for investing activities higher in the first
    six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2022?
  sentences:
  - used for investing activities was higher in the first six months of 2023 compared
    to the first six months of 2022, primarily due to the absence of proceeds from
    the divestiture of our NAND business and proceeds for our remaining share of McAfee,
    both of which occurred in the first six months of 2022; as well as higher capital
    expenditures in the first six months of 2023. These unfavorable cash impacts during
    the first six months of 2023 were partially offset by the favorable cash impacts
    of higher maturities and sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, and
    lower investment activity in other investments and acquisitions during the first
    six months of 2023. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily
    of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term
    and long-term debt, and partner contributions. Cash provided by financing activities
    in the first six months of 2023 compared to cash used for financing activities

    2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical
    conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events
    may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Many of the risks
    discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which
    could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us. Business and Industry Risks
    We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely
    competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border

    costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies

  sentences:
  - to “design- out” U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance
    burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide.
    As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand
    for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such
    as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls
    increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because
    by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral
    export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase
    investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted
    by U.S. controls. Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government
    on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect
    our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may
    adversely affect our Data Center

  sentences:
  - Table of Contents For 2023, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably
    impacted by the foreign income deduction and U.S. federal research and development
    credit and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains
    and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and
    may cause variability in our effective tax rate. Our income tax benefit for the
    nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion
    of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to a valuation loss related
    to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the nine months
    ended September 30, 2023 was $4.1 billion, which included $175 million of net
    discrete tax expense, primarily consisting of discrete tax expense related to
    shortfalls from stock-based compensation and approximately $600 million of tax
    benefit resulting from a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated
